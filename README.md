Program created to be efficient in contacting parents. Contact is important to keeping parents up to speed with their student's progress.
Focused on bar graphs from JFreeChart and sending them out to student's parents, then skewed to GUI for modular emailing system.

The intention is to send emails quickly and with the ability of being modular. The system uses the student's name instead of bulk vague emails about your 'student', 
making it a bit personal.

The bottom text area is the console. If the email doesn't send because of an error, at least you'll know which student it stopped at so you can send it manually.
This also helps track progress of the emailing process.

Bar graphs are generated and sent out with the same process but using the IDE (IntelliJ)

Emails would finally be sent out to each parent/guardian in a few minutes. In our case, it would take 12 minutes to send 162 emails
